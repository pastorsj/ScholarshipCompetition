            Instituted in 2006, the Federal Funding Accountability and
            Transparency Act (FFATA) requires that federal contract, loan, and
            other financial assistance awards of more than $25,000 are displayed
            on a publicly accessible and searchable website to to provide the
            American people better access to information on government revenue
            and spending.

            >. Through a variety of processes, the US government ensures the
            quality of the data sourced through multiple internal data systems.
            Here, the focus is looking at the investments made by the
            government, through contracts and the subsequent investments in
            subcontracts. Contracts are an agreement creating mutual obligations
            between parties that are enforceable by law. Government contracts
            specifically are contracts between the US government and businesses
            that "obligate the seller to provide the supplied or services
            (including construction) and the buyer (the US Government) to pay
            for them"

            In a recent executive order from the Biden Administration,
            cybersecurity standards for United States defense contracts have
            become much more rigorous. However, according to an article in CPO
            Magazine, "a survey of 300 small-to-medium business defense
            contractors found common failures to comply with CMMC requirements,
            with 48% having severe vulnerabilities"
            <a

              >(CPO Magazine)</a
            >. This is highly concerning on the National Security front where
            the US government must worry about cyberattacks to both the
            government and to their defense contractors. Recently, a list of
            critical and emerging technologies was announced by the Fast Track
            Action Subcommittee on Critical and Emerging Technologies (CETs) of
            the National Science and Technology Council. This list included
            Artificial Intelligence, Biotechnologies, Quantum Information
            Technologies, and Hypersonics. In particular, hypersonics is of
            great interest to the Department of Defense. Hypersonics generally
            applies to weapons that travel over five times the speed of sound
            and are challenging to stop. Combining these concerns and national
            security interests, the National Security Agency is able to
            prioritize new methods of determining critical subcontractors in the
            supply chain and where to boost their cybersecurity protection.

            There are two steps in determining the businesses that must
            prioritize improving their cybersecurity protection. First, a list
            of all of recent contracts and contractors needs to be filtered to
            only those that provide specific type of technologies (based on the
            CETs). Second, for every contractor, a list of subcontractors must
            be retrieved and filtered to only those that supply specific
            capabilities or products to the prime contractor. In the following
            analysis, the focus is primarily on the second step.

            In 2016, the Department of Defense awarded a contract to Raytheon
            for the second phase of the Hypersonic Air-Breathing Weapon Concept.
            Raytheon is one of the largest "aerospace, intelligence services
            providers, and defense manufacturers in the world"
            <a

            >. According to the USA Spending website, they have been awarded
            over $4.7 billion in contracts, primarily from the Department of
            Defense, and primarily for products including guided missiles and
            bombs

              target="_blank"
              >(Raytheon Contracts)</a
            >. From the contract description and the company that was awarded
            the contract, it can be determined that Raytheon is an important
            company in which the US government should have a vested interest in
            protecting from cybersecurity threats. According to the contract,
            there are 348 subcontracts spanning 79 unique subcontractors that
            supply products and services to Raytheon, but it is not yet clear
            which subcontractors should be prioritized in the same way that
            Raytheon will be. The following sections will visualize the
            subcontractor data in such a way so that it will become clear which
            subcontractors are more important in the supply chain. First, in
            <i>Figure 1</i>, a timeline shows the Raytheon contract plus a

            Using the above timeline, several important dates and subcontracts
            stood out immediately when manually inspecting the data. First, the
            Raytheon contract started in October of 2016 and ended as of March
            2022. Prior to the Raytheon contract, several large subcontracts
            were awarded to Alliant Techsystems, which upon closer inspection
            and further research, is tied to Northrup Grumman, a well-known
            American aerospace and defense company. These subcontracts turn out
            to be far more significant than any of the other subcontracts, so
            this is the first indication that this subcontractor is essential.
            Lastly, after doing a brief search through the subcontracts, there
            is a clear indication that some of these businesses provide critical
            supplies for building hypersonic devices. Two subcontracts are
            shown, one that provides batteries (Advanced Thermal Batteries) and
            one that provides accelerometers and cables (Dytran).

            In <i>Figure 2</i>, the viewer gets the first taste of the
            progression of all of the subcontracts awarded during the time of
            the Raytheon contract. This progression might be traceable to the
            steps for producing the hypersonic missiles. For example, the
            earlier subcontracts would be vital as they supply parts for the
            missiles, while the later subcontracts would be for testing and
            validation purposes.

            After looking at the timeline and a brief preview of the
            subcontracts, it seems that two paths should be taken to determine
            the importance of a subcontract. One indication could be the cost of
            the subcontract. Outlying subcontracts that cost far more than
            others could be a good indicator. Secondly, contracts that supply
            specific parts used to build hypersonic missiles are equally
            important. First, let's take a closer look at well-funded
            subcontracts. A high-level, hierarchical visualization of all
            subcontracts and their associated costs is seen in <i>Figure 2</i>.

            First, in <i>Figure 3</i>, it is important to note the flow of
            funding. At the heart of the chart, the Department of Defense
            oversees the contract. Outside of the Department of Defense, two
            specific federal accounts provide the funding to Raytheon: DARPA and
            DCMA. These federal accounts seem to have similar purposes, but in
            the grand scheme of US contracts, perhaps it would be prudent to
            keep track of the federal accounts that fund these contracts. In
            <i>Figure 3</i>, it is clear from the onset that Alliant Techsystems
            is the most well-funded subcontractor. As Alliant Techsystems was a
            large aerospace and defense company before being acquired by
            Northrup Grumman, this makes sense.

          <div class="col-lg-11 mx-auto my-1">
            However, a limitation of this chart is that Alliant Techsystems is
            so large that it overwhelms the rest of the subcontracts to the
            point where it is unclear how large the rest are. It would be much
            easier to visualize the relative funding size of the rest of the
            subcontracts by filtering out Alliant Techsystems from the chart. To
            see this filtered visualization <i>(Figure 4)</i>, click on the tab
            labeled "Filtered Contract Funding."

            In <i>Figure 4</i>, it is much easier to see the relative size of
            the subcontracts. By clicking on the inner slices, it becomes more
            evident that subcontractors such as Orbital Sciences, Pacific
            Scientific and Ensign Bickford have relatively large subcontracts.
            These larger subcontracts seem important, but it would be helpful to
            understand what the subcontracts were for. In the subsequent
            visualization, <i>Figure 5</i>, a better idea of the details of
            these subcontracts can be seen.

            one subcontract with Raytheon. The network in <i>Figure 5</i> shows

            Using the network above, it is clear again that Alliant Techsystems

            propulsion, and rocket motors. A highly funded contract for a
            business that makes parts specifically for hypersonic missiles
            certainly stands out.

            There are clear limitations in the network created in
            <i>Figure 5</i>. It seems that most of the highly funded contracts
            are described as <i>Firm Fixed Price</i> or
            <i>Cost Plus Fixed Fee</i>. Considering the scope of the data set,
            no amount of data analysis provides any more information about these
            contracts, so perhaps filtering these types of contracts out could
            provide better insights. It is important not to throw away these
            contracts as unimportant, but to gain more clarity and narrow the
            focus of this search, filtering out these type of contracts is a
            logical next step.

            By click on the next tab, <i>Figure 6</i> shows the filtered version
            of the subcontracts. Here, it is clearer which companies should be
            inspected. Alliant Techsystems and Aerojet Rocketdyne are present,
            but other subcontractors begin to stand out.
            <b>Dynetics Technical Solutions</b> has large subcontracts for
            materials (one of the CETs!) and fuselages.
            <b>L3 Technologies</b> has multiple contracts for encoders. Finally,
            <b>Ducommun</b> has a large number of contracts for supplies such as
            cable assemblies and CCAs (Circuit Card Assemblies). By narrowing
            down the number of subcontractors to 8-10 from a much larger list,
            it becomes easier to see which should be considered a higher
            priority for a cybersecurity analysis and further protection as an
            asset to the US government.

          <div class="col-lg-11 mx-auto my-1">
            After diving into subcontracts and learning more about how contracts
            were funded, it is clear that well-funded subcontracts are
            important. The contractor that makes significant investments in
            subcontractors clearly sees them as critical assets in completing
            their contract with the US government. However, not all subcontracts
            are well funded, but many of those are essential. For example, a
            subcontract that specifically provided washers would not be
            expensive relative to subcontracts that provide rocket fuselages,
            but the former is critical to the end product. Therefore, a second
            approach is needed to identify critical subcontractors. By utilizing
            the descriptions of the subcontracts and what is known about
            hypersonic missiles, descriptions that contain specific keywords
            should be considered more important than others.

              A simple wordcloud can be used to visualize the types of keywords
              seen in the descriptions of subcontracts. In
              <i>Figure 7</i>, the most common keywords are seen in larger text.
              This indicates more descriptions containing this keyword. From
              this visualization, some keywords begin to stick out as they
              relate to the production of hypersonic missiles.

            In <i>Figure 7</i>, keywords including batteries, detonators,
            launchers, fuses, and transmitters (among others) stand out. These
            are words that describe supplies critical to hypersonic missile
            production. By finding the subcontracts that provide these products,
            cybersecurity protection efforts can target these companies.

            associated with the production of hypersonic missile technologies,
            it becomes clearer which subcontractors are a higher priority.
            However, after further analysis, there are two types of
            subcontractors. First, some subcontractors provide a single product,
            such as batteries or explosives. Second, some contractors provide
            more than one product. Depending on the US government's priorities,
            an argument could be made either way for prioritizing one type of
            subcontractor versus another. A simple visualization of the
            subcontracts is seen in the following figure.

            Considering the results shown in <i>Figure 8</i>, there are
            arguments for prioritizing cybersecurity efforts for each type of
            subcontractor. First, subcontractors that provide a single service
            to the main contractor could be considered a single point of
            failure. If they are the only subcontractor that provides a critical
            piece to the production of hypersonic missiles, then they should be
            considered more vulnerable to a cybersecurity threat. In contrast, a
            company that provides multiple different parts to the production of
            hypersonics could also be considered vulnerable as it would be a
            significant disruption to the supply chain.

            In <i>Figure 9</i>, the network shows the set of subcontractors that
            produce only a single item according to their subcontract's
            description. This network gives us the first view into which
            subcontracts could be considered more important than others, and by
            proxy, which subcontractors would be a cybersecurity risk.
            Everything behaves similarly to the previous networks; however, the
            blue triangles representing the subcontracts show the keywords found
            in their respective descriptions. This helps the viewer get a sense
            of each subcontractor and what they supply. All of these
            subcontractors stand out as they only supply one type of product to
            Raytheon, so one might suppose that all of them should be
            prioritized highly. However, there are many subcontractors in this
            network, so it would be helpful to continue to filter them down.
            <b
              >An important observation that can be made in <i>Figure 9</i> is
              that some of these subcontractors are unique in what they produce.
              For example, Southern Gear & Machine seems to be the only
              subcontractor that produces gears. This is considered a single
              point of failure.</b
            >
            Perhaps by filtering down to those that produce distinct products, a
            clearer view of the most critical subcontractors can be seen.
            Discuss findings in the network. Theorize that some of the
            subcontracts are far more important, and using this network, we can
            see which subcontracts provide which. This allows Raytheon to single
            out their subcontractors they believe are more important when it
            comes to a single product.

            Before transitioning to the final, filtered down network, a second
            network in <i>Figure 10</i> shows all of the subcontractors
            producing more then one product. Subcontractors in this network are
            important because they produce so many products for Raytheon, so
            losing them to a cybersecurity attack could slow down production
            significantly.

            in Figures 7-10.

              >These 13 subcontractors shown in <i>Figure 11</i> are considered

            As previously hypothesized, Southern Gear & Machine was indeed the
            only company to produce gears and thus should be considered a single
            point of failure. However, there are many more. Emoteq produces
            shafts, API produces washers, and L3 produces encoders.
            Additionally, the subcontractors that produce multiple products are
            included if one of those products is unique across all
            subcontractors. For example, Alliant TechSystems is the only
            producer of fuselages and detonators, while Aerojet Rocketdyne seems
            to be the only producer of pyrotechnics and rockets.
            <b
              >However, the most important observation to be made happens while
              exploring this network. Out of the 13 subcontractors, 2
              subcontractors stand out.</b
            >
            AllComp Inc has different sets of subcontracts for two different and
            unique products. One set of subcontracts is for fasteners, and
            separately, one is for missiles and antennas. Next, Pacific
            Scientific Energetic Material Company has two sets of subcontracts,
            one set for explosives and separately, one for nuts. These two
            subcontractors should be considered the most important and most
            vulnerable to a cybersecurity incident.

            Two methods were utilized to attempt to prioritize a list of 79
            subcontractors in order of importance in the supply chain. The first
            method, finalized in <i>Figure 6</i>, explored the subcontract
            funding and theorized that higher funded subcontracts were more
            important to the main contractor versus other contractors.
            Subcontractors like Alliant Techsystems are more important when
            Raytheon awarded them multiple subcontracts worth 5-10 times more
            than any other subcontract awarded to the rest of the
            subcontractors. It was not clear what each of the subcontracts for
            Alliant Techsystems was for, but investing that much capital into
            that many subcontracts is a clear outlier.
            <b
              >Regardless of what each subcontract is for, Alliant Techsystems
              should be targeted for more protection against cybersecurity
              attacks.</b

            The second method utilized the description of each subcontract to
            narrow the focus to subcontractors that produced unique products
            critical to the supply chain. The final iteration, shown in
            <i>Figure 11</i>, shows a set of 13 subcontractors that are critical
            to the supply chain.
            <b
              >Two of these subcontractors, AllComp Inc and Pacific Scientific
              Energetic Material Company have multiple different contracts for
              different types of unique product. These two subcontractors should
              be targeted for more protection against cybersecurity attacks.</b

            In this analysis, three subcontractors were chosen out of 79 total.
            Using this analysis, the US government should specifically focus its
            efforts on these three companies. However, they should not lose
            sight of the rest of these subcontractors. For further
            consideration, there are many subcontractors in this contract that
            should be considered high priority and are single points of failure.
            In <i>Figure 11</i>, 13 subcontractors were considered single points
            of failure for this contract. A simple table that prioritizes each
            subcontract based on multiple criteria like funding and the product
            they supply would give an excellent view of the cybersecurity
            priority level. A viewer would find it helpful to have one table
            ordering all subcontractors by priority level with an explanation
            behind the order being automatically generated through the code
            powering these visualizations.
