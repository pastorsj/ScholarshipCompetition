        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-11 mx-auto my-1">
            In 2006, the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act was
            signed into law and required that federal contract, loan, and other
            financial assistance awards of more than $25,000 be displayed on a
            publicly accessible and searchable website to give the American
            people access to information on how their tax dollars were being
            spent. Through a wide variety of processes, the US government
            ensures the quality of the data sourced through multiple internal
            data systems. Here, the focus is looking at the investments made by
            the government through contracts and the subsequent investments in
            subcontracts. Contracts are an agreement creating mutual obligations
            between parties that is enforceable by law. Government contracts
            specifically are contracts between the US government and businesses
            that "obligate the seller to provide the supplied or serivces
            (including construction) and the buyer (the US Government) to pay
            for them" (USA Spending).

        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-11 mx-auto my-1">
            In a recent executive order from the Biden Administration,
            cybersecurity standards for United States defense contracts became
            much more rigorous. However, according to an article in CPO Magazine
            (insert link), "a survey of 300 small-to-medium business defense
            contractors found common failures to comply with CMMC requirements,
            with 48% having severse vunerabiltiies" (CPO). This is extremely
            concerning on the National Security front, where not only does the
            US governmnent need to worrty about themselves being vunerabvle to
            cyber attacks, but they also need to worry about their defense
            contractors being vunerable. Recently, a list of critical and
            emerging technologies was announced by the Fast Track Action
            Subcommittee on Critical and Emerging Technologies (CETs) of the
            National Science and Technology Council. This list included
            Artificial Intelligence, Biotechnologies, Quantum Information
            Technologies, and Hypersonics. In particular, hypersonics, is of
            great interest to the Department of Defense. Hypersonics generally
            applies to weapons that travel in excess of five times the speed of
            sound and are hard to stop. Combining these concerns and national
            security interests, the National Security Agency is prioritizing new
            methods of determining contractors that are critical in the supply
            chain and therefore need to boost their cybersecurity protection.

            There are two steps to determining the businesses that need to
            prioritize improving their cybersecurity protection. First, a list
            of all of the recent contracts and contractors needs to be filtered
            down to only those that provide a specific type of technologies
            (based on the CETs). Second, for every contractor, a list of
            subcontractors must be retrieved and filtered down to only those
            that supply specific capabilties or products to the prime
            contractor. In the following analysis, the focus is primarily on the
            second step.

        <h3 class="text-dark my-3">Visualizing Subcontracts</h3>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-11 mx-auto my-1">
            In 2016, the Department of Defense awarded a contract to Raytheon
            for the second phase of the Hypersonic Air-Breathing Weapon Concept.
            Raytheon is one of the largest "aerospace, intellegence services
            providers, and defense manufacturers in the world". According to the
            USA Spending website, they have been awarded over $4.7 billion in
            contracts, primarily from the Department of Defense, and primarily
            for products like guided missles and bombs
            (https://www.usaspending.gov/recipient/01c4a3a3-b4c5-ce4e-822b-d17f09985001-C/latest).
            Clearly, from the contract description and the company that was
            awarded the contract, Raytheon is an important company that the US
            government should have a vested interest in protecting from
            cybersecurity threats. However, according to the contract, there are
            348 subcontractors that supply products and services to Raytheon,
            but it is not yet clear which subcontractors should be prioritized
            in the same way that Raytheon will be. The following sections will
            visualize the subcontractor data in such a way so that it will
            become clear which subcontractors are more important in the supply
            chain. First, in <b>Figure 1</b>, a very basic timeline shows the
            Raytheon contract and a couple of subcontracts awarded around the
            time of the official contract.

            Using the above timeline, there are a number of important dates and
            subcontracts that stood out immeditely when looking at the data
            manually from a high level. First, the Raytheon contract started in
            October of 2016 and ended as of March 2022. Before the contract was
            awarded, a number of large subcontracts were awarded to Alliant
            TechSystems, which upon closer inspection and further research, is
            tied to Northrup Grumman, a well known American aerospace and
            defense company. These subcontracts turn out to be far larger than
            any of the other subcontracts, so this is the first indication that
            this subcontractor is important. Lastly, after doing a brief search
            through the subcontracts, there is a clear indication that some of
            these business provide critical supplies for building hypersonic
            devices. Two subcontracts are shown, one that provides batteries
            (ATB) and one that provides accelerometers and cables (Dytran).

            To dive deeper into the timeline and get our first sense of all of
            the subcontracts, a second timeline chart shows the dates when a
            contract or multiple contracts were awarded by Raytheon. To explore

            In Figure 2, the viewer gets the first taste of the progression all
            of the subcontracts awarded during the time of the Raytheon
            contract. This progression could be tracable to the steps for
            producing the hypersonic missles. For example, the earlier
            subcontracts would be important as they are supplying parts for the
            missles, while the later subcontracts would be for testing and
            validation purposes.

            After looking at the timeline and a brief preview of the
            subcontracts, it seems that two pathes should be taken to determine
            the importance of a subcontract. One indication could be the cost of
            the subcontract. Outlying subcontracts that cost far more than other
            subcontracts could be a good indicator. Secondly, contracts that
            supply specific parts that are used to build hypersonic missles are
            equally important. First, let's take a closer look at well funded
            subcontracts. A high level, hierarchical visualization of all of the
            subcontracts and their associated costs is seen in Figure 2. To
            explore this visualization, click on any of the inner slices of the
            chart to get a breakdown of costs.

            First, in <b>Figure 3</b>, it is important to note the flow of
            funding. At the heart of the chart, the Department of Defense is
            overseeing the contract. Outside of the Department of Defense, there
            are two specific federal accounts that provide the funding to
            Raytheon: DARPA and DCMA. Both of these federal accounts seem to
            have similar purposes, but in the grand scheme of US contracts,
            perhaps it would be prudent to keep track of the federal accounts
            that fund these contracts. In <b>Figure 3</b>, it is clear from the
            onset that Alliant Techsystems is the most well funded
            subcontractor. As Alliant Techsystems was a large aerospace and
            defense company before being aquired by Northrup Gromman, this makes
            sense.

          <div class="col-lg-11 mx-auto my-1">
            However, a limitation of this chart is that Alliant Techsystems is
            so large, it overwelms the rest of the subcontracts to the point
            where it is unclear how large they are. It would be much easier to
            visualize the relative funding size of the rest of the subcontracts
            by filtering out Alliant Techsystems from the chart. To see this
            filtered visualization <b>(Figure 4)</b>, click on the tab labeled
            "Filtered Contract Funding".

            In <b>Figure 4</b>, it is much easier to see the relative size of
            the subcontracts. By clicking on the inner slices, it becomes
            clearer that subcontractors such as Orbital Sciences, Pacific
            Scientific, and Ensign Bickford have relatively large subcontracts.
            These larger subcontracts seem important, but it would be helpful to
            understand what the subcontracts were for. In the next
            visualization, <b>Figure 5</b>, a better idea of the details of
            these subcontracts can be seen.
